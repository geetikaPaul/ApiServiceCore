While developing an application that can be desktop or web in C#, such kind of requirement to extract the filename from a given path (where the path can be taken while selecting a file using File Open dialog box or any other sources) can arise. A path may contain the drive name, directory name(s) and the filename. To extract filename from the file, we use “GetFileName()” method of “Path” class. This method is used to get the file name and extension of the specified path string. The returned value is null if the file path is null.
